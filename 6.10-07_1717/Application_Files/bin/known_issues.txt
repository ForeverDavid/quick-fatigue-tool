* ANHD/HD MATLAB Figure is invisible after more than one analysis if %APPDATA% is cleared between analyses

* For unique nodal datasets with multiple regions (duplicate node IDs) the ODB interface has no way of knowing which node is which when
  re-ordering the LABEL parameter for the Abaqus API. Workaround is to use integration point or element-nodal stresses

* Number of nodes appears to mismatch when calculating the peek analysis item

* The ODB interface does not check the connectivity data properly. When checking if an analysis node belongs to the
  current element, QFT uses the set of all analysed nodes, rather than just the nodes at that element
