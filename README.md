# Quick Fatigue Tool for MATLAB
Stress-based multiaxial fatigue analysis application for MATLAB

This is the GitHub repository for Quick Fatigue Tool v6. Feel free to clone or download the code at your leisure. For a detailed description of the code, please refer to the Quick Fatigue Tool User Guide, which is found in                                         quick-fatigue-tool/6.xx-xx/Documentation/.

## Getting Started
Preparing Quick Fatigue Tool requires minimal intervention from the user, although it is important to follow a few simple steps before running an analysis:

1. Make sure the working directory is set to the root of the Quick Fatigue Tool directory, e.g. \..\Quick Fatigue Tool\6.x-yy. The directory structure is shown in Figure 1.

2. All folders and sub folders should be added to the MATLAB search path using the function addpath(), or by selecting the folders Application_Files and Project, right-clicking and selecting Add to Path â†’ Selected Folders and Subfolders.

If the MATLAB working directory is not configured exactly as described above (e.g. the user enters the job directory before running a job file), the application will not run.
